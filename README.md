This is a collection of different implementations of a simple 2D dungeon
game, "Dandy Dungeon". I wrote the original version in 6502 assembly for
the Atari 800.

I've written versions in the following languages since then:

+ C++
+ C#
+ F#
+ Python
+ JavaScript
+ coffee-script

It is a little obsessive-compulsive to keep revisiting the same program,
but it helps me get a feel for a new programming language. Perhaps it might
be useful for other people wishing to compare and contrast different programming
langauge styles.
