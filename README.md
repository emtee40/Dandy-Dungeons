This is a collection of different implementations of a simple 2D dungeon
game, "Dandy Dungeon". I wrote the original version in 6502 assembly for
the Atari 800. (Alas my source code has been lost in the mists of time.)

I've written versions in the following languages since then:

+ coffee-script
+ C++ (for Xbox and Windows)
+ C# (1.0, 1.2, 2.0)
+ Dart
+ F#
+ Python
+ JavaScript

It is a bit obsessive-compulsive to keep revisiting the same program,
but it helps me get a feel for a new programming language. Perhaps it might
be useful for other people wishing to compare and contrast different programming
langauge styles.
