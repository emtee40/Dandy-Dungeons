This is Dandy Dungeon written using CoffeeScript

http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/

CoffeeScript's syntax and semantics are changing frequently. The
version of CoffeeScript used in this code is version 0.5.6

The dandy.coffee file has been compiled into a dandy.js file,
which is checked into the source tree.

Remarks

This is currently just a direct translation from the JavaScript
version of the game. No attempt has been made (yet) to optimize for
CoffeeScript's unique features.
