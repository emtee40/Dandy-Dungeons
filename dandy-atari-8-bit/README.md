# Dandy 1.2 for the Atari 400/800 8-bit computers

This is the original source code for Dandy.

It was written for the Synapse Assembler.

Thanks to Kevin Savetz for reading my ancient floppy disk backups.

If you're interested in studying the source, the
MAIN.TXT file is the main file, that includes the other files.

Not a lot of comments. :-)
